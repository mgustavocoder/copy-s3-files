# Description
Just copy the objects from a folder in an S3 bucket to another, in the same bucket.

## But why?
So, I had a motivation to do that, you I don't know =)

## How to run it.

Before all, run the **npm install** command =)

## Setting envs and constants.
In the index.js configure the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY and AWS_SESSION_TOKEN (optional)
Configure the constants.js file, change it as desired.

### Running
- npm start
